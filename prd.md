**Clarifying user preferences**

The user has provided detailed preferences for building a full-stack Rails site, with input for crypto or stock tickers, verifying their existence, and displaying key indicators like RSI, MACD, TTM Squeeze, Volume, and Moving Average Ribbon. They‚Äôve asked to analyze multiple timeframes, and show when indicators align across timeframes. They prefer free data providers, crypto-first, and the TradingView widget. They also want a responsive, dark-themed site with color pop-ups and optional user login. No disclaimers are needed, and it's all to be polished in English.

**Planning for PRD and citations**

The next step is to produce a PRD (Product Requirements Document) requirement table that incorporates the features the user requested. I'll gather sources to support the solutions, such as free APIs like Alpha Vantage, IEX, Binance, and TradingView. To ensure accuracy, I'll use web searches to find references for technical choices like tools, APIs, and technical indicators. I'll need at least 10 high-quality citations from solid sources like TradingView, GitHub, and Investopedia. Then I‚Äôll structure them into the PRD.


**Gathering resources for PRD**

I need to search for various resources that will support the development of the PRD. I'll look for APIs like Alpha Vantage and Finnhub, definitions for indicators like the Moving Average Ribbon and TTM Squeeze, and resources for Ruby gems that help with technical analysis. I also want to include references for browser localStorage and relevant indicators like RSI and MACD. The goal is to collect at least 10 quality sources from a variety of trusted domains.

**Gathering sources for PRD**

I need to gather a variety of high-quality sources across at least five unique domains like TradingView, Alpha Vantage, Binance, Investopedia, and more. So far, I've collected 12 sources but I should aim for at least 15. I'll search for relevant technical indicators like RSI, Volume, and TTM Squeeze, as well as for localStorage usage in Rails. These citations will support decisions about APIs, indicators, and features for the PRD.


**Gathering more sources**

I‚Äôve already gathered 12 sources, but it would be great to aim for at least 15. I‚Äôm searching for technical indicators like RSI and Volume confirmations, plus definitions for the TTM Squeeze. I‚Äôll also look for information on ‚ÄúBrowser localStorage favorites rails.‚Äù I‚Äôm focusing on high-quality sources from a variety of domains, like TradingView and Binance, to make sure we have a well-rounded collection for the project.

**Compiling sources and PRD doc**

I‚Äôve managed to gather 20 sources, which is great! Now, moving on to the next step: creating the PRD document. I need to make sure I include a summary first, followed by sections with high-quality citations, and I‚Äôll use markdown for headers. I'll detail functional requirements - things like allowing ticker input, scanning indicators, a watchlist, and a TradingView chart integration. Don‚Äôt forget non-functional requirements like reliability, latency, and hosting. I‚Äôll reference everything with citations for clarity.


Thought for 46 seconds


CryptoScreen is a dark‚Äëthemed, mobile‚Äëresponsive Rails site that lets you type **any ticker (crypto‚Äëfirst, stocks OK)**, automatically validates it against free APIs (e.g.,‚ÄØAlpha‚ÄØVantage,‚ÄØFinnhub, Binance) and shows only the indicators that are *actually firing* on eight selectable time‚Äëframes (15‚ÄØm,‚ÄØ1‚ÄØh,‚ÄØ2‚ÄØh,‚ÄØ4‚ÄØh,‚ÄØ24‚ÄØh,‚ÄØ48‚ÄØh,‚ÄØ1‚ÄØw,‚ÄØ1‚ÄØmo). It embeds a TradingView chart next to the signal panel, highlights multi‚Äëindicator or multi‚Äëtime‚Äëframe ‚Äúconfluence‚Äù in real time, and lets you bookmark favorites to browser‚ÄØlocalStorage. No database is required‚Äîoptional lightweight login can be added later. Below is a PRD in the same style as your Urlist example.

## Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements

### Data‚ÄØ&‚ÄØLatency

* **Free APIs**: Alpha‚ÄØVantage offers crypto, stocks, and 50+ indicators with 5‚Äëcalls/min limit¬†([Alpha Vantage][12]); Finnhub provides technical‚Äëindicator endpoints (RSI/MACD) and crypto pairs with 60 calls/min¬†([Finnhub][13]); Binance‚Äôs public REST supplies spot‚Äëcrypto candles with no key¬†([Mixed Analytics][14]).
* Cache raw candles in server memory for 15‚ÄØmin to honor rate limits yet feel ‚Äúlive.‚Äù

### Tech¬†Stack

* **Rails¬†7** (API mode) + **Hotwire** (Turbo¬†+¬†Stimulus) for reactive UI; StimulusReflex for server‚Äëpushed refresh¬†([docs.stimulusreflex.com][6]).
* **Ruby‚ÄØTA‚ÄëLib‚ÄØFFI** gem to compute indicators locally¬†([GitHub][15]). Falls back to Finnhub indicator endpoint if TA‚ÄëLib unavailable.
* Frontend uses **TradingView JS widget** for charting (license‚Äëfree embed)¬†([TradingView][4]).

### Hosting &‚ÄØOps

* Fits free tiers on Fly.io or Render; Postgres optional (only for future login). Static assets CDN‚Äëcached.
* CI/CD via GitHub Actions; full test suite with RSpec.

### Security &‚ÄØCompliance

* No PII stored without login; CSRF protected; uses HTTPS. ‚ÄúFor entertainment only‚Äù banner optional per decision (no legal disclaimer currently).

### Accessibility

* WCAG‚ÄØ2.1 AA color contrast; keyboard‚Äënavigable popovers; prefers‚Äëreduced‚Äëmotion fallback.

## Indicator Confirmation Logic (Baseline)

| Indicator    | Bullish¬†Confirm                                                                                                              | Bearish¬†Confirm                                                                   | Sources |

| Volume¬†Spike | Candle closes higher on volume‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ150‚ÄØ% of avg¬†20‚ÄØbar¬†([The Forex Geek][11], [Trading Setups Review][18], [Investopedia][19]) | Candle closes lower on spike                                                      |         |
| MA¬†Ribbon    | Price closes above majority of EMAs; ribbon fanning upward¬†([HowToTrade][3], [Investopedia][9])                              | Price closes below; ribbon inverting                                              |         |

*(Thresholds configurable in constants.)*

## Next Steps

1. **Wireframes/UI Kit** ‚Äì Sketch grid + chart layout, confluence badges, popups.
2. **Data Adapter Layer** ‚Äì Implement service classes for Alpha‚ÄØVantage, Finnhub, Binance; memoize.
3. **TA‚ÄëLib Integration** ‚Äì Dockerfile installs TA‚ÄëLib C libs; fallback remote indicator call.
4. **Hotwire Views** ‚Äì Turbo‚ÄØStreams to update cells; Stimulus controller for localStorage favorites.
5. **Dark Theme & Animations** ‚Äì Tailwind + Framer Motion; test contrast.
6. **Deployment** ‚Äì Push to Fly.io free plan; set ENV keys; configure cron‚Äëstyle scheduler if auto‚Äërefresh on server side.

This PRD should cover all the functionality you requested while keeping everything free‚Äëtier friendly, polished, and fun. Let me know if you‚Äôd like any tweaks or deeper detail!
